# TomatoScript
TomatoScript is a dynamically typed programming language specialised in automating tasks with simple and concise syntax.
## Getting Started
Given you have both `interpreter.py` and `run.py` downloaded, make sure you also have `pyautogui` installed, this is the backbone for the automation scripts.<br>
## Syntax and Tutorial
TomatoScript *(being a pun on automation->automato->tomato)* is geared towards automating tasks, and has a bulk of the standard library dedicated to it, however, Tomato still features all the things you would expect from a programming language<br>
Lets start with printing. There are two ways in which you can print output, `println`, which adds a newline at the end of the value and `print`, which doesnt have a newline. For example:<br>
```rust
println("Hello")
println("World!")
> This would output "Hello
```
